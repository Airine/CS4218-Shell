1. Introduction
CS4218 covers the concepts and practices of software testing and debugging. An important portion of CS4218 is the
project work. Through this project students will learn and apply testing and debugging techniques followed by quality
assessment activities. Teams of students will implement a shell and test its functionality using different testing
techniques that will be taught during the course.
Students will learn how to professionally apply testing approaches and techniques with the state of art testing
automation framework JUnit. Students will be shown good and poor styles of manual unit-test generation. Students will
evaluate the quality and thoroughness of the test cases and project code using different coverage metrics. They will
apply testing, debugging and other quality assurance activities in a simulated industrial setting.
2. Project Teams
Students should form teams of maximum 4 at the beginning of the semester. Once formed, teams would be final for the
duration of the course.
3. Coding
All programming assignments must be completed using JAVA. External libraries/plugins should not be used. The
implementation should not rely on network communication, databases. You should not rely on any platform-specific
functionality. Use Java properties “file.separator” and “path.separator” when working with file system. Use
“line.separator” property when working with newlines, since different operating system may use different separator.
Your code must conform to CS4218 code conventions. These conventions are checked automatically using PMD tool (see
installation instructions in LumiNUS). Your methods should not be too long (more than 50 lines of code). You must have
proper Javadoc comments for every method. Follow the Java naming convention. Use naming convention for test classes.
For example, test class for the class name “Foo” should be called “FooTest”. For test method, explain the scenario that
you are testing (e.g., for a test that check for negative value for method foo, use name like testFooNegativeValue).
