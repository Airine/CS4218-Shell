Instructions on TDD

* This folder contains unit tests for applications and functionalities for BF, EF1 and EF2. Add the tdd folder to your test package and run. 
* There are a few test cases using Mockito that require supporting libraries aside from Mockito-core. If you are not using any dependency manager, you can just download them and add it to IntelliJ through Project Structure > Module > Dependencies: 
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.objenesis/objenesis/2.6
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.bytebuddy/byte-buddy/1.9.10
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.bytebuddy/byte-buddy-agent/1.9.10
* You are not mandated to make a test case pass if it fails due to difference in implementations. 
* You can edit the test cases or add additional test cases.
