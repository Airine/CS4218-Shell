8.6. Globbing
Example
ls articles/* Display the names of all the files in the articles directory.
Syntax
The symbol * (asterisk) in an unquoted part of an argument is interpreted as globbing.
Semantics
For each argument ARG in a shell command that contains unquoted * (asterisk) do the following:
1. Collect all the paths to existing files and directories such that these paths can be obtained by
replacing all the unquoted asterisk symbols in ARG by some (possibly empty) sequences of non-slash characters.
2. If there are no such paths, leave ARG without changes.
3. If there are such paths, replace ARG with a list of these path separated by spaces.
Note that globbing (filenames expansion) is performed after argument splitting.
However, globbing produces several command line arguments if several paths are found.
